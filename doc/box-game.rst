Box game example
****************

In this game we describe an experiment involving the player have to make two different, though interrelated decisions at each round.

In this game the player is given a choice of opening one of two boxes, 1 or 2, one of which contains a reward.
An automated defender is defending one of the boxes, but it can defend only one.
The player first chooses the box they are considering opening, but does not yet open it.
The player is then given feedback by the defender, potentially warn that the box is defended; however this warning may or may not be true.
The player then chooses whether or not to open the box. Opening an actually undefended box that contains the reward earns the player 100 points.
Opening a box that is truly defended costs the player 50 points.
Not opening a box, or opening a box that does not contain the reward has no effect on the player's score.
